Zork Hill - A console based combination of Zork and Silent Hill.

To run:  As of now this is Linux only.  Windows or Mac versions may come at a later date.
	 No need for root, this app can run as a normal user.

Grab zork_hill.tar.bz2 and extract to a directory of your choice:
```
tar -xvjf zork_hill.tar.bz2
```

This will create a directory called './dist'.
```
cd ./dist
./zork_hill
```

NOTE:  zork_hill MUST currently be ran from the directory it resides in.  A fix for this may come at a later date.
